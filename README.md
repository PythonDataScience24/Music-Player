# S-Wave

## About

Welcome to S-Wave, a project developed as part of the Programming for Data Science course at the University of Bern. S-Wave is a music playing platform designed to put the user in complete control of their music experience. With S-Wave, users can upload their own *.mov* files, creating a personalized music library. Not only can users upload music files, but they can also add metadata such as artist name, genre, release year, and more, allowing for easy organization and filtering of their library.

S-Wave goes beyond being just a storage platform. It provides a user-friendly GUI with intuitive features that allow users to not only play music but also personalize their listening experience. Users can amplify tracks and visualize soundwaves through plots, giving them a deeper connection to their favorite music.
